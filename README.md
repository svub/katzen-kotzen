# A Vibe Coding Experiment 

Basically didn't touch any code. Fun experience. The agent got stuck twice but the results are ... interesting I'd say. But when people tell me that coding as a job is done for, they are usually not familiar with coding themselves. 

I wouldn't recommend coding without AI these days -- why would you? -- but it's still far from doing anything that's a bit more complex just by itself. 

Looking forward to the next level of AI coders and we shall try again!
